# Mirror Web Application Progress Report

## Project Status: In Progress

**Mirror** aims to provide a platform for users to share their mental health updates with doctors. The application is being developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

## Overview

**Mirror** is a solo project aimed at facilitating a connection between patients and doctors to enhance mental health support. The core features include:

- **Patient Updates:** Patients can create posts detailing their current mental health status, providing doctors with valuable insights between appointments.

- **Doctor Notes:** Doctors can access patient updates and add corresponding notes. This feature will enable doctors to provide personalized advice and maintain a history of patient progress.

## Achievements

I've successfully built the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Mirror web application. The MVP encompasses:

- User authentication system for patients and doctors.

- Functionality for patients to compose and list their mental health updates.

- Establishment of a basic backend structure to manage user data and updates.

## Next Steps

The upcoming development phase involves adding the frontend and implementing the doctor notes functionality:
